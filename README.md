# Semantic-UI Orion Admin Theme

This is the unstyled version of the Orion Admin Theme. This theme is a replica of the ```orionjs:bootstrap``` package. The markup and styles have been updated to use Semantic-UI. This package is for orion developers that would prefer to use semantic-ui for their projects.

## Installation

While in your meteor app's root, run the following from the command line:

```
$ meteor add dvz:orion-semantic-ui
```

## Package Details

This package depends on ```semantic:ui``` meteor package, so make sure you add it into your project. It will automatically add ```useraccounts:semantic-ui ```. Since Summernote relies on bootstrap, you would need to use ```orionjs:froala``` or another editor.
